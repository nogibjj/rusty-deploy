## Rust Deployment Experiments

My hypothesis is RUST is the ideal language for LLMOPs, NOT PYTHON.

### Workflows to Prove Out for Rust MLOps Deployment

#### Distroless

###### Rust T5 Model


##### PyTorch Distroless Pre-Trained Model

* [Package PyTorch into a Rust Distroless Container](https://github.com/nogibjj/rusty-deploy/tree/main/rtorchdist)

##### Hugging Face Distroless Pre-Trained Model

#### Binary Deployment

* Statically Linked ONNX to Rust Binary
* Statically Linked PyTorch to Rust Binary
* Statically Linked HuggingFace to Rust Binary
